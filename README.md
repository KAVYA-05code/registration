🚀 Created a Responsive Registration Form with Real-Time Validation

Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript

Designed and developed a fully responsive registration form using HTML for structure, CSS for styling and responsiveness, and JavaScript for real-time input validation. The form ensures a smooth user experience with immediate feedback on input correctness.

Key Features:

✔️ Name field validation to prevent empty input

✔️ Email validation (accepts only properly formatted emails)

✔️ Password validation (minimum 6 characters)

✔️ Live error messages and visual cues

✔️ Submit button is automatically enabled only when all inputs are valid

✔️ Fully responsive layout using media queries for mobile and desktop

💡 This project highlights my front-end development skills, attention to user experience, and ability to build interactive web forms.
